## 11083926

This assignemt is split into three main task

### Task One

This task is to manipulate an array by checking each value if it is perfectly divisible by 2 using the modulo operator "%" the after, if true (as if it divides by 2 with no remainder meaning it is even) it sqaures, if not (it is odd) it multiplies by three.

### Task Two
This task is to take in two arrays as arguments and then modifies the elements in the stringArray based on the output we get in the newNumbersArray. If the coresponding index value in newNumbersArray is even we capitalise, if odd we turn the string into lowercase

### Task three
In this task we create a new file useInfo and a function inside it called createUserInfo. The createUserInfo is then exported and used in our main file arrayManipulation to produce a user profile based on the output we get in teh formatedStrings and newNumbersArray based on the same result as task 2


### Generated Output
With this, when arrayManipulation is run it will display the original arrays for numbers and srtings, the newNumbersArray and the formattedStringsArray (as formattedStrings) and finally will give us the user profiles as an array of objects
